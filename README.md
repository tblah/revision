On-line backup for my revision for my A2 exams

Use this stuff for anything non commercial.

This is just an opportunity for me to play with Atom's git plus package and get an online backup of my revision while I am at it.

If you find this useful then please fork or message me as I will probably delete this repo once I am done using it.

The physics notes are based on my notes from lessons and the computing notes are based on the computing specification from AQA.
