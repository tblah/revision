**Stiffness** is to do with the difficulty of stretching or bending a material. 

**Hardness** is to do with how difficult it is to dent a material.

**Brittleness** is to do with how easy it is to snap a material. 

**Toughness** is to do with how hard it is to snap a material: *This is the opposite of brittleness*. This is how resistant the material is to cracking.

**Plastic Deformation** is to do with permanent stretching or distortion of a material.

**Elasticity** is to do with the ability of a material to regain its original shape after deformation.

**Ductility** is to do with how easy it is to draw a material into a wire.

**Malleability** is to with how easy it is to hammer or push a sheet of material into the right shape.
